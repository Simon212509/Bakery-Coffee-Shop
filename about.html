        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>At Roll, baking is more than just a craft—it’s a passion passed down through generations. Our founders, inspired by the simplicity and tradition of European bakeries, set out to create a space where high-quality bread and pastries could be enjoyed by all. With a background in artisanal baking and a deep appreciation for coffee culture, they opened Roll to share their love of freshly baked goods with the community.</p>

        <p>From the very beginning, we’ve been committed to using the best ingredients and methods. Our sourdough is slow-fermented for up to 48 hours, our pastries are hand-laminated for the perfect layers, and our coffee is sourced from ethical growers who prioritize sustainability. Every detail matters to us, from the first fold of dough to the final pull of espresso.</p>

        <p>Our bakery is more than just a place to grab a quick bite—it’s a gathering spot for neighbours, a workspace for freelancers, and a warm retreat from the bustle of daily life. We love seeing familiar faces and meeting new customers who quickly become part of our extended family.</p>

        <p>We also believe in giving back to the community that supports us. That’s why we donate surplus baked goods to local charities and strive to reduce our environmental footprint through responsible sourcing and waste reduction.</p>

        <p>At Roll, we invite you to experience the magic of fresh, handmade food. We hope that every visit leaves you feeling nourished, inspired, and eager to return.</p>

        <h2>Our Ingredients</h2>
        <p><strong>Flour & Grains</strong><br>
        Our bread and pastries are made using stone-milled flours sourced from small mills that prioritize quality and sustainability. This ensures that our doughs have a rich depth of flavor and superior texture, perfect for our signature sourdough loaves and delicate croissants.</p>

        <p><strong>Dairy & Eggs</strong><br>
        We use organic dairy products, including butter and milk, from local family farms. Our eggs come from free-range hens, ensuring a higher quality ingredient that enhances the taste and texture of our baked goods.</p>

        <p><strong>Chocolate & Sweeteners</strong><br>
        Our pastries and desserts feature ethically sourced chocolate from farms that uphold fair-trade principles. We sweeten our treats with natural cane sugar, local honey, and organic maple syrup, avoiding artificial additives and preservatives.</p>

        <p><strong>Coffee Beans</strong><br>
        We take our coffee seriously, which is why we partner with small-scale coffee growers who use sustainable farming practices. Our beans are carefully selected and roasted to highlight their unique flavor profiles, resulting in a perfectly balanced cup of coffee every time.</p>

        <p><strong>Fruits & Nuts</strong><br>
        We source fresh, organic fruits from local orchards, ensuring that every tart and pastry bursts with natural sweetness. Our nuts are carefully chosen for their quality and flavour, adding depth to our baked goods.</p>

        <p><strong>Commitment to Sustainability</strong><br>
        In addition to sourcing responsibly, we minimize waste by donating surplus baked goods to local charities and using eco-friendly packaging. By prioritizing sustainability, we strive to make a positive impact on our environment and community.</p>

        <p>At Roll, every ingredient tells a story, and we take pride in crafting food that not only tastes amazing but is made with integrity and care.</p>
